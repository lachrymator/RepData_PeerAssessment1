```{r}
## File Location

fileurl<- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"

## Download file to a temporary location, read in dataframe, and delete tempfile

temp<-tempfile()
download.file(fileurl, temp)
filename<-unzip(temp, list=TRUE)[[1]]
data<-read.csv(unzip(temp,filename), na.strings = "NA")
unlink(temp)
unlink(filename)
```
